					<h1>Langa For Men</h1>
					<p>Our vision is to create a safe space for every gender and also
						involve everyone in the fight for women and young girls. We are all
						affected by gender based violence.<br>
						We want to reprogramme the minds of men and invest in a young boy
						child using different methods; such
						as Boys to Men, Youth Empowerment sessions, Educational Camps,
						Hiking’s, Healing sessions, Boys Workshops. </p>

					<h3>Why was #LangaForMen founded?</h3>
					<p>
						For so many years we've been seeing women and young girls being
						violated by our gender and as a result they having many campaigns to
						stop that. From our observations they are not really helping to the
						great extent as many are the victims. Perpetrators continue even
						though there are these campaigns, prayer services, pickets and
						March.
						We saw that there is a big need of finding the seed that is leading
						men into doing these evil things before finding solutions. A boy
						child
						has been failed by society for so many times. They are not expected
						to
						cry and in order for them to be heard they need to raise their hands
						on women. 63 years later while South Africa is now a democratic
						country, women continue to remain marginalized and largely oppressed
						by a patriarchal system that perpetuates misogynist attitudes,
						stereotypes and behavior against women. For us to eradicate femicide
						we need to instill and restore new values to a boy child. Values
						that
						will make a boy child not to see a girl child as an object. Thus it
						has come to our attention, how do we bridge the gap between the
						National Legislation enacted to protect our people and the violence
						including the stigmas which are highly prominent in our societies?
						How
						do we go about implementing better Legislations that can protect
						human
						rights better? How do we go about implementing Legislations that
						would
						really hold accountable all the perpetrators and not invade justice?
						How do we go about to supporting the victims and giving them better
						facility to overcome these issues? How do we go about making sure
						that
						we are safe in our societies? How do we go about enforcing the
						police
						force to do their jobs properly, sufficiently and professionally?
						These are questions according to our perception needs some serious
						answers and attention.</p>

						<h3>How was #LangaForMen founded?</h3>
						<p>
							#LangaForMen started in the middle of August 2019 by two young
							boys
							aged 21 years who've been involved in organizations that are
							advocating for rights of the people. Luyolo Lengisi and Siyabonga
							Khusela saw the need of opening an organization that would help a
							boy child to be better men not be a perpetrator but to be a
							protector
							by respecting the society and understanding the real meaning of
							manhood.

						<h3>Where was #LangaForMen founded?</h3>
						<p>
							This started in a small township known as Langa with a
							heterogeneous
							fund of experience, social and cultural backgrounds, academic
							knowledge, skills and ideas. As a matter of fact, thanks to his
							enthusiasm, commitment and judgment because him and I have been
							able
							to establish not just a challenging debate for us but interesting
							inputs and innovative ideas.
