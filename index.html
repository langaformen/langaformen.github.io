					<h1>Langa For Men</h1>
					<p>Our vision is to create a safe space for every gender and also
						involve everyone in the fight for women and young girls. We are all
						affected by gender based violence.<br>
						We want to reprogramme the minds of men and invest in a young boy
						child using different methods; such
						as Boys to Men, Youth Empowerment sessions, Educational Camps,
						Hiking‚Äôs, Healing sessions, Boys Workshops. </p>

					<h2>Why was #LangaForMen founded?</h2>
					<p>
						For so many years we've been seeing¬†women and young girls being
						violated¬†by our gender and as a result they having many campaigns to
						stop that. From our observations they are not really helping to the
						great extent as many are the victims. Perpetrators¬†continue even
						though there are these campaigns, prayer services, pickets and
						March.
						We saw that there is a big need of finding the seed that is leading
						men into doing these evil things before finding solutions. A boy
						child
						has been failed by society for so many times. They are not expected
						to
						cry¬†and in order for them to be heard they need to raise their hands
						on women. 63 years later while South Africa is now a democratic
						country, women continue to remain marginalized and largely oppressed
						by a patriarchal system that perpetuates misogynist attitudes,
						stereotypes and behavior against women. For us to eradicate femicide
						we need to instill and restore new values to a boy child. Values
						that
						will make a boy child not to see a girl child as an object. Thus it
						has come to our attention, how do we bridge the gap between the
						National Legislation enacted to protect our people and the violence
						including the stigmas which are highly prominent in our societies?
						How
						do we go about implementing better Legislations that can protect
						human
						rights better? How do we go about implementing Legislations that
						would
						really hold accountable all the perpetrators and not invade justice?
						How do we go about to supporting the victims and giving them better
						facility to overcome these issues? How do we go about making sure
						that
						we are safe in our societies? How do we go about enforcing the
						police
						force to do their jobs properly, sufficiently and professionally?
						These are questions according to our perception needs some serious
						answers and attention.</p>

					<h2>How was #LangaForMen founded?</h2>
					<p>
						#LangaForMen started in the middle¬†of August 2019 by two young
						boys
						aged 21 years who've been involved in organizations that are
						advocating for rights of the people. Luyolo Lengisi and Siyabonga
						Khusela saw the need of opening an organization that would help a
						boy¬†child to be better men not be a perpetrator but to be a
						protector
						by respecting the society and understanding the real meaning of
						manhood.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where was #LangaForMen founded?</h2>
					<p>
						This started in a small township known as Langa with a
						heterogeneous
						fund of experience, social and cultural backgrounds, academic
						knowledge, skills and ideas. As a matter of fact, thanks to his
						enthusiasm, commitment and judgment because him and I have been
						able
						to establish not just a challenging debate for us but interesting
						inputs and innovative ideas.

								Siyabonga grew up in a township called Langa in Cape Town, he
								was raised by a young vivacious single parent, mother. Siyabonga
								being the only child never really knew what it meant to be a
								kid. Since the adults around him were overly protective, he
								didn't learn how to really relate well with other kids.
								<br><br>

								Growing up Siyabonga felt accustomed to the company of his
								single mother. He was always more matured than other children
								even when he gained friends he always enjoyed the company of his
								mother. Siyabonga's mother always invested alot in him-this
								encouraged him to excel in everything he does including his
								subjects in primary school and in high school.
								<br><br>

								Siyabonga never really realized the concept of self-awareness
								growing up until years later. While Siyabonga was in High school
								he started to feel the pressure of his late mother and family's
								expectations. Gradually he stopped everything he was doing and
								focused more on his books which made him achieve an outstanding
								beautiful Bachelor's pass.<br>
								On this year Siyabonga graduated on top of his class, although
								he wasn't a valedictorian looking back Siyabonga believes he
								would've done better.
								<br><br>

								Late 2018 Siyabonga believes all doors opened for him. In 2018
								Siyabonga was introduced and exposed to the modeling industry by
								Lushawn Yaso. Lushawn saw a great potential in him, he forced
								him to excel in the modeling industry. This was the birth of
								everything great for Siyabonga.<br>
								Throughout his modeling career, in 2019 Siyabonga ventured to
								other parts of the industry. He started doing runway modeling,
								high fashion modeling and other related services. In middle 2019
								Siyabonga reached a climax in his career where he founded a very
								successful organization named "Helping Hands". This organization
								aimed at helping individuals who are previously disadvantaged
								and can not afford certain things for them. In here Siyabonga
								stepped in and did the very best to eradicate this in his
								society. Till today he is recognized for his beautiful gesture
								in his society. After the peak of this organization, another
								gargantuan organization #LangaForMen was co-founded by him
								alongside his partner. The aim of this organization was to raise
								awareness in the society about these gross gender based violence
								faced by women and children everyday. This organization made a
								mark in the township as everyone is now cognizant of their aims
								and objectives. In here Siyabonga and his partner made few
								appearances on huge social media platforms and the internet.
								They were interviewed by few journalists and broke the internet.
								With no doubt this has been the most popular experience they
								have ever experienced.
								<br><br>

								Today Siyabonga considers himself a Human Rights Activist
								because of his beautiful work regarding the human rights in his
								society and also considers himself a feminist because he
								advocates for equal treatment of women in the society. Siyabonga
								Khusela has enormous plans to achieve, to be the best he could
								ever be, branch deeper in his organizations and becoming the
								best and well mannered model in his modeling agency.
