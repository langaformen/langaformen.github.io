# hellbox

Every lightbox bragging itself as "lightweight" or "simple" is just too bloated and complicated - at least what I found on internet. Keeping it simple, use this 666 bytes long vanilla javascript like

```
<a href="big_image.jpg" class="hellbox" target="_blank">
  <img src="thumbnail.jpg">
</a>
```

Clicking the thumbnail.jpg shows big_image.jpg in a lightbox. Clicking anywhere closes it and returns the user to the page. If the javascript is forbidden, the big_image.jpg shows in a new tab as it should. Nobody expects any other feature, so don't add any.
